# Health For Her: Maternal Mortality Analysis in Africa

## Project Overview

This repository contains the analysis and visualization of maternal mortality data across African countries between 2012 and 2022. The focus is to support **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.1**: *Reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births*.


## Objective

The goal of this analysis is to:
- Understand maternal mortality trends across regions in Africa
- Investigate the correlation between maternal health outcomes and health expenditure
- Identify high-risk areas and inform targeted interventions


## Dataset Description

- **Source**: [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org)
- **Timeframe**: 2012–2022
- **Region**: African countries only
- **Key Indicators**:
  - **Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)** – Deaths per 100,000 live births
  - **Number of Maternal Deaths**
  - **Lifetime Risk of Maternal Death**
  - **Current Health Expenditure (% of GDP)**


## Tools Used

- **Excel** – Data cleaning and merging
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation


## Data Cleaning Process

- Filtered data for African countries only
- Removed duplicates
- Managed missing values
- Merged multiple datasets into a single, clean file for analysis


## Key Insights

- Over **2 million maternal deaths** recorded between 2012 and 2022
- **West and East Africa** bear the highest burden of maternal deaths
- Despite high investment in health in some regions, outcomes remain poor—especially in **Central Africa**
- **Regional variation** is significant; targeted strategies are required


## Visualizations Included

- MMR trend line (2012–2022)
- Regional breakdown of maternal deaths and health expenditure
- Lifetime risk of maternal death per region
- Top 3 countries with highest vs. lowest MMR


## Call to Action

1. **Strengthen maternal care systems**
   - Improve access to skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care
2. **Invest smarter, not just more**
   - Prioritize maternal healthcare in national budgets
3. **Promote education and awareness**
   - Increase literacy and health knowledge among women and communities
